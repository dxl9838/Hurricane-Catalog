# Hurricane wind field modeling
## Gradient wind speeds
Hurricane gradient wind speeds in every 10 minutes are generated based on Georgiou (1985)'s gradient wind field model and the hurricane catalog developed by Fangqian Liu (2014). Examples of hurricane tracks are shown in the following figure:

An example of the calculated gradient wind speeds is shown as follows:

## Surface wind speeds
Surface wind speeds at 10 meters height are calculated considering the gradient-surface transition and sea-land transition suggested by Vickery et al. (2009a). The calculated wind speed and direction records of for a location of interest is shown in the following figures. It is seen that the pattern of hurricane wind speed and direction records are different for different hurricanes. If the location of interest is very close to the hurricane eye track, the wind speed record usually will have two peaks and the drop of the wind speed in the middle is due to the near zero wind speed in hurricane eye. On the contrary, if the location of interest is further from the hurricane eye track, the wind speed record will only have one peak.
